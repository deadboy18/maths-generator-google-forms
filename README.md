## ⚙️ How It Works

This script uses the [Google Apps Script](https://developers.google.com/apps-script) environment to:

1. Randomly generate math questions
2. Create a new **sheet** with questions and answers
3. Generate a **Google Form** linked to that sheet
4. Export printable **PDFs** for both student and teacher
5. Auto-mark responses and sync to Sheets

---

## 📁 Setup Instructions

1. Go to [script.new](https://script.new)
2. Paste in the [`Code.gs`](./Code.gs) contents
3. Save and name your project (e.g. "Maths Generator")
4. Run the function `batchGenerateMathsQuizzes`
5. Accept the permission prompts

Done! You’ll now find:
- Forms in your **Google Forms**
- Sheets in your **Drive**
- PDFs in **separate folders per Aktiviti**

## 📌 Limitations

- ❌ Does not handle fractions, decimals, or word problems
- ⚠️ Limited to 4 Aktiviti per run due to **execution time limits**
- ❌ Not designed for advanced math or older students (yet)
